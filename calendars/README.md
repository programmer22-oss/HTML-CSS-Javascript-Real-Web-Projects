# Simple Calendar Web Component

This web component displays a simple calendar for the current month.  It's built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and doesn't require any external libraries.

## Usage

1. Include the HTML, CSS, and JS in your project.
2. Add a `<div id="calendar"></div>` to your HTML where you want the calendar to appear.

## Features

* Displays the current month's calendar.
* Highlights the current day.
* Differentiates past and future days.

## Future Improvements

* Add navigation to switch between months and years.
* Add event integration (display events on specific days).
* Implement better accessibility.
* Make it more responsive to screen size.

## Note

This calendar is a frontend-only implementation. The original request mentioned Python Flask, but this example focuses on the client-side rendering of a calendar.  To integrate this with a backend (like Flask), you would likely use a framework to fetch and display event data, etc.
