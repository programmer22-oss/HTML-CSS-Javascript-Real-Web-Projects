    <h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
    <div class="author">by Robert Frost</div>

    <div class="Poem">
        <p>
            <span>Some say the world will end in fire,</span>
            <span>Some say in ice.</span>
            <span>From what I've tasted of desire</span>
            <span>I hold with those who favor fire.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span>But if it had to perish twice,</span>
            <span>I think I know enough of hate</span>
            <span>To say that for destruction ice</span>
            <span>Is also great</span>
            <span>And would suffice</span>
        </p>
